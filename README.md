# Creating Interactive Figures with Plotly + Python

Plotly is a versatile plotting package that can be used with Python to create interactive figures to explore your data in real time.  In this workshop you will learn how to create a variety of figures with Plotly.  We will explore COVID-19 data together, but I encourage you to bring your own data as well.  The workshop will be hands-on, running through a Jupyter notebook.  Some prior Python knowledge is required.  

If you would like work directly on your computer, please make sure that you have Python installed.  I recommend installing Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Then you can create and activate a new environment for this workshop by typing the following commands into your (bash) terminal.

```
conda create -n plotly-env python=3.9 jupyter pandas plotly statsmodels
conda activate plotly-env
```

If you cannot install Python or Plotly on your computer (or you prefer not to do so), you can use the [version on Google colab linked here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19St1EyUwPXINJiLElcQ6QzM2mx3XmdP9/view?usp=sharing).

A live version of the final interactive, containing data up to Mar. 8, 2022, is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/IntroToPlotly/plotly_graph.html).
